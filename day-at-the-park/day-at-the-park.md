## Getting Started

From your `challenges` folder in the terminal, type the following commands:

```no-highlight
$ et get day-at-the-park
$ cd day-at-the-park
$ atom .
```

To run your code:

```no-highlight
$ ruby code.rb
```

## Exercise

On the way home, you're recording some info about about how the day went.

Following the demo below, use variables to store information about the day, and then use those variables to print the answers to the following questions! Save your code in the provided `code.rb` file.

The info referenced by the **bold** words below should be replaced by variables.

Remember, you can name your variables whatever makes sense to you.

- What **size sundae** did you get?
- **Who** screamed the loudest on a ride?
- What **color of cotton candy** was the most delicious?
- What was the **water temperature** in the wave pool?
- Was your favorite ride emotion **crazy** or **calm**?

```ruby
# Set your variables here:
sundae_size = "large"


# Print your phrases here:
puts "I got a " + sundae_size + " sundae, and it was delicious."
```

Try not to overthink it.
This exercise is designed to be short, and to build your confidence as a programmer.
Simply assign the variables (based on what is in all capital letters in the bullets above) and output the values you've assigned.  You may use concatenation _or_ string interpolation.
