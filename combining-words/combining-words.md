## Exercise

While you're standing in line for a ride, you and your friends decide to play a game where you all tell a story, by each saying one word at a time in turn.

Practice adding together strings by writing six separate words, each wrapped in their own set of quotations, and using the plus sign to [concatenate][Concatenate Definition] the strings.

Put the code you've written to do this in the provided `code.rb` file. Use the `puts` command at the beginning of your line of code to print your results to the command-line interface (CLI).

If you'd like to make things a little more challenging, assign your words to variables and print your string by concatenating the variables!

As a reminder, you can run this code with `ruby code.rb`.  After you're finished, don't forget to submit with `et submit`.
